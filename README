The sieve syntax file is based on 'Sieve: A Mail Filtering Language' (RFC3028) by The Internet Society 2001 (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3028.html).

Sieve is a proposed internet-standard language for effectively filtering mail. It can delete mail, redirect messages other mail boxes or automatically save mail into a specific folder.

A good overview of the language and its capabilities can be found at http://www.cyrusoft.com/sieve/.

For an installation follow the instructions in ':help syntax'.
